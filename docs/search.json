    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic of this project focuses on how active video games — games that require players to move their body to play — can help to reduce sedentary habits among children. We choose this topic because we have personally experienced the effects of sitting for long hours in front of computer and phone. At the start of this October I suffered from neck and shoulder ache due to my poor posture and inactivity. Eventually, I bought a monitor stand and started doing light exercises to fix it.So we are interested in how similar inactivity affects kids who spend even more time on screens, and whether games that involve movement could make physical activity more enjoyable for them. This project aims to explore how playing active video games influences children’s daily activity levels and preferences for active versus sedentary play, and whether these games can serve as a creative bridge between digital entertainment and a healthier lifestyle.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe draw on three main datasets from the project “The influence of active video game play upon physical activity and screen-based activities in sedentary children”, published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and available on DATA.GOV.\nThe data are provided in CSV and Excel formats and are static, with the last metadata update on June 5, 2025. The demographics dataset (52 rows × 8 columns) includes measured and self-reported information such as height, weight, birth year, and ethnicity. The liking dataset (151 × 7) contains children’s self-reported ratings (1–10) of how much they enjoy various physical and sedentary activities at baseline, week 6, and week 10. The ActiGraph dataset (1,536 × 15) is collected using wearable accelerometer devices and provides objective, high-resolution physical activity data over multiple time points. While the data quality is generally strong, with most participants having complete records, some minor missing values appear in the liking data. A potential limitation is the reliance on self-reported responses for some variables, which may introduce bias.",

In these rows, the raw CPM data are present, but the derived physical activity variables were not calculated. This suggests a data processing issue rather than a problem with the device itself. Since this represents a very small portion of the dataset, we drop these observations in the remaining analyses.\n\n\nCode\nactigraph_raw |&gt;\n  count(Timepoint) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Timepoint, y = n)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = 1), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of Children with Actigraph Data by Timepoint\",\n    x = \"Timepoint\",\n    y = \"Number of Observations\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, we can find the total number of observation varies at different timepoint. This indicates some participants only participate certain trials. Though this is not counted as typical missing value (no NA, just missing some rows).
