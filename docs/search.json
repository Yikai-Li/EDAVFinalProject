    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe focus of this project is to examine how active video games — which require players to move their bodies — can increase children’s motivation to engage in physical activity (measured by MVPA). We choose this topic because we have personally experienced the effects of sitting for long hours in front of computer and phone. At the start of this October I suffered from neck and shoulder ache due to my poor posture and inactivity. Eventually, I bought a monitor stand and started doing light exercises to fix it.So we are interested in how similar inactivity affects kids who spend even more time on screens, and whether games that involve movement could make physical activity more enjoyable for them. This project aims to explore how playing active video games influences children’s daily activity levels and preferences for active versus sedentary play, and whether these games can serve as a creative bridge between digital entertainment and a healthier lifestyle.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWe draw on three main datasets from the project “The influence of active video game play upon physical activity and screen-based activities in sedentary children”, published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and available on DATA.GOV.\nThe data are provided in CSV and Excel formats and are static, with the last metadata update on June 5, 2025. The demographics dataset (52 rows × 8 columns) includes measured and self-reported information such as height, weight, birth year, and ethnicity. The liking dataset (151 × 7) contains children’s self-reported ratings (1–10) of how much they enjoy various physical and sedentary activities at baseline, week 6, and week 10. Also, there is group when group = 0, kids need to play the games chosen by parents. When group = 1, they have autonomy and can choose their own game to play. The ActiGraph dataset (1,536 × 15) is collected using wearable accelerometer devices and provides objective, high-resolution physical activity data over multiple time points. While the data quality is generally strong, with most participants having complete records, some minor missing values appear in the liking data. A potential limitation is the reliance on self-reported responses for some variables, which may introduce bias.",

While there’s a lot of day-to-day variation, we can see some general ups and downs that might reflect seasonal changes — like people being more active during warmer months and less so in the winter.\nThat said, this plot alone doesn’t offer conclusive evidence about the video game’s impact on physical activity. However, it gives us a useful overall picture of how MVPA fluctuated throughout the study period. To better assess potential effects of gameplay, we’ll next look at changes in MVPA across defined timepoints — from baseline to later weeks.",

At first glance, using MVPA/Total Minutes might me more suitable than using MVPA it self as the proportion of children taking MVPA of the child’s total minutes tracked. Hence, to proceed with further analysis, we first ask the question that whether MVPA would be correlated with total minutes. Here we can tell that most children wear the ActiGraph whole day, which corresponds to 1440 minutes. Some children wear it around 750 minutes per day, which corresponds to around 12 hours, this is potentially due to children not wearing it during sleep time. The randomness of the MVPA for all total minutes per day, except for the left most few cases where the total minutes are too low, aligns with the hypothesis as sleeping time doesn’t affec MVPA since children need to be awake to perform vigorous and moderate physical activities. Therefore, we can use MVPA directly moving forward in this study.",

We can observe from the graph that there exists a clear increasing trend for physical activities time as ratings of physical activities increases, meaning that children would do more physical activities if they like them more. We do observe that also the sedentary activities minutes decreases when the rating of physical activities changes from around 9 to 10, it’s mainly at a constant time. This might indicate that except children who likes physical activities heavily, children tends to have similar sedentary activities time. However, the trend for the sedentary liking rating graph is not that clear. We do observe that the sedentary activities time increases as rating increases from 6 to 7 and from 8 to 9, but it decreases from 5 to 6, 7 to 8 and 9 to 10. The points with a rating lower than 5 seems to be outliers. We also observe that there are fewer data at rating 8, where the physical activities time also behaves out of pattern as it tends to be decreasing as the sedentary liking rating increases but increases sharply at rating 8, which might indicate that the results at rating 8 is not that significant. Besides these cases, we can say that children are mostly honest and can mostly reflect themselves precisely. This means that we can trust their answers for questionnaires currently and future studies can investigate further upon results from the questionnaires.",

    "text": "In this study, we examined the relationships between MVPA (moderate to vigorous physical activity time) and different variables, where we especially focused on AVG (active video games) related variables. From our graphs, we observed that MVPA doesn’t have a clear relationship with times but do have some variations between different time points. Our main finding is that AVG associates with MVPA, meaning that playing active video games can help increase children to do more physical activities. The willing of children to play active video games can also lead them into doing more physical activities, which is likely due to them playing more AVGs. Our conclusions are partially based on questionnaires, which we tested to be mostly reliable in this study. Further studies can be done on verifying the findings through more technical methods.These insights support the broader motivation of our project, which is to explore whether active games can serve as a practical tool to help reduce sedentary habits and make physical activity more enjoyable for children.",
