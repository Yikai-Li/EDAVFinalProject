    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe topic of this project focuses on how active video games — games that require players to move their body to play — can help to reduce sedentary habits among children. We choose this topic because we have personally experienced the effects of sitting for long hours in front of computer and phone. At the start of this October I suffered from neck and shoulder ache due to my poor posture and inactivity. Eventually, I bought a monitor stand and started doing light exercises to fix it.So we are interested in how similar inactivity affects kids who spend even more time on screens, and whether games that involve movement could make physical activity more enjoyable for them. This project aims to explore how playing active video games influences children’s daily activity levels, motivation, and preferences for active versus sedentary play, and whether these games can serve as a creative bridge between digital entertainment and a healthier lifestyle.",
